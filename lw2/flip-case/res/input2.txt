type WaitGroup struct {
	// contains filtered or unexported fields
}

A WaitGroup is a counting semaphore typically used to wait for a group of goroutines or tasks to finish.

Typically, a main goroutine will start tasks, each in a new goroutine, by calling WaitGroup.Go and then wait for all tasks to complete by calling WaitGroup.Wait. For example:
var wg sync.WaitGroup
wg.Go(task1)
wg.Go(task2)
wg.Wait()
